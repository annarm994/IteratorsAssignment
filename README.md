# Iterators Assignment

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of iterators in Java for different collection types: `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `TreeMap`. The tasks involve iterating through these collections, modifying them during iteration, and analyzing data.

## Tasks:
### Task 1: Iterating over an ArrayList
- Created an ArrayList of integers, populated with random values.
- Used an iterator to traverse and calculate the sum of elements.
- Demonstrated modification during iteration by removing even numbers.

### Task 2: Using Iterators with HashMap
- Created a HashMap to store categories with their respective values.
- Used an iterator to iterate over the map's entry set and print key-value pairs.
- Demonstrated modifying entries and safely removing items during iteration.

### Task 3: Advanced Operations with TreeMap
- Created a TreeMap where keys are months and values are average temperatures.
- Used an iterator to find and print the highest and lowest temperatures.
